## 👋 Hi there, I'm Tiffany Wu!

### About Me

I am a doctoral student in the [Combined Program in Education and Psychology (CPEP)](https://soe.umich.edu/academics-admissions/cpep) at the University of Michigan and am pursuing a dual master's degree in [Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/masters_students/mastersprograms/dualmasters.html). I am also an [IES Causal Inference Predoctoral Fellow](https://edpolicy.umich.edu/training/predoctoral-fellowship) and [2022 APPAM Equity & Inclusion Fellow](https://www.appam.org/about-appam/awards/2022-equity-inclusion-fellowship-student-recipients/).

At the University of Michigan, I work with [Dr. Christina Weiland](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/christina-weiland/). Broadly, my research weaves machine learning, AI, causal inference, and psychometric methods to design, evaluate, and scale PK-12 tools and interventions. I am deeply committed to using data science to advance educational opportunity and equity. I am also committed to collaborating as part of research-practice partnerships that make scholarship more publicly accessible and closely attuned to the lived experiences of students, families, and practitioners across diverse educational contexts.

My research is deeply influenced by my previous work as a public high school teacher in Chicago and then as a research analyst for an education non-profit prior to starting my PhD. In my free time, I like to paint, play the piano, and play pickleball.

### Art
*"A line is a dot that went for a walk." - Paul Klee*

People often refer to art that is created by coding in the R statistical programming language as "Rtistry" or "aRt". In my free time, I love merging my love of art with the technical framework of code.

Here you'll find code for some of the pieces on my Github page, so feel free to take a look if you're interested!
